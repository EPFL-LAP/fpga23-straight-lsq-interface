# Straight to the Queue: Fast Load-Store Queue Allocation in Dataflow Circuits

This repository holds the source code, benchmarks and results of the work presented in the paper entitled "Straight to the Queue: Fast Load-Store Queue Allocation in Dataflow Circuits".

## Prerequisites

In order to reproduce the main results, the following dependencies are needed:
1) Dynamatic's virutal machine (VM) through the following link https://dynamatic.epfl.ch/ which contains the LLVM infrastructure, the Dynamatic tool and Modelsim
2) Guorobi which is an MILP solver needed in Dynamatic's buffer placement
3) Vivado 2019.2

## Code Organization and Result Reproduction

This repository is organized as follows:
1) elastic-circuits/
2) Buffers/
3) components/
4) dot2vhdl/

To reproduce results:
1) Download Dynamatic's virutal machine (VM)
2) Inside the VM, install Guorobi
3) Clone this repository [SPECIFY A LOCATION?]
4) Run the script [NAME] in [WHICH DIRECTORY] to install the plugins of this paper into Dynamatic's infrastructure
5) Run the script [NAME] in [WHICH DIRECTORY] to generate the results. The script runs our 8 benchmarks one after the other on our tool to generate circuits then it simulates the generated designs and prints the cycle count in [FILENAME]. You can check the simulation results generated by Modelsim in [DIRECTORY] [GIVE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW LONG THIS STEP IS]
6) Run the script [NAME] in [WHICH DIRECTORY] to synthesize our generated circuits using Vivado. The script synthesizes the generated circuits one after the other. You can check the clock period of each benchmark in [FILENAME] and the resources in [FILENAME].

To check the results of our two baselines:
